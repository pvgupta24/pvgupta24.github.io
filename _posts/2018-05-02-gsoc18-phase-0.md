*Phase 0* because indexing starts with *ZERO*. Period ;)

### What is Google Summer of Code ?
> *Google Summer of Code is a global program focused on bringing more student developers
into open source software development. Students work with an open source organization on
a 3 month programming project during their break from school/university.*

It is a program supported and funded by Google to support open source organisations where
the mentors from the selected organisations provide guidance to the students and help them
in contributing in the right direction.

### What is Jitsi ?
> *Jitsi is a set of open-source projects that allows you to easily build and deploy secure
videoconferencing solutions. At the heart of Jitsi are Jitsi Videobridge and Jitsi Meet, 
which let you have conferences on the internet, while other projects in the community enable
other features such as audio, dial-in, recording, and simulcasting.*

You can try out the platform from the browser here : [https://meet.jit.si/](https://meet.jit.si/)

### My Project Proposal
My major aim in the project proposal is to improve the transcription service in Jitsi-Meet and
integrate a translation module in it for real time transcription with translation.

### Mentors
I will be mentored by [Boris Grozev](https://github.com/bgrozev) and [Nik Vaessen](https://github.com/nikvaessen).
Nik was a GSoC student with Jitsi in the previous two summers and I will be working to
improve and further extend his work.<br>
You can read more about his contributions in his blog [here](https://nikvaessen.github.io).

### Community Bonding Period
We have had a couple of video meets using the same platform to discuss more about the
project. We are further discussing about the pros and cons of client-side translations
vs. server-side translations to finalize it.

Development Environment is being setup along with a VM to support it for testing out
changes separately.

> Exciting summer ahead. Lets get started ;)
