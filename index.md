I work broadly at the intersection of Data Management, Cloud & Software Engineering. **[Detailed Resume here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1B3-ET43azqNzidnU2WaKNvVTsnACwLvh/view)**

My current research focusses on data compliance solutions in serverless workflows at The University of British Columbia. Prior to this, I was a Research Fellow at Microsoft Research from 2020-22 and graduated from NITK Surathkal in 2020. Apart from work, I like to play basketball, badminton and am always up for outdoor adventures!

I like interesting conversations and love helping out folks based on my experiences. Please reach out on my socials at **@pvgupta24**.
